Computer Graphics - C++ Introduction - Transformations - Shading - Ray Intersection - Blender

- C++ Introduction consists of several exercises to be solved using c++. The exercises are split up into two generic c++ exercises and a couple matrix/vector related c++ exercises.
- Transformations consists of two exercises. Complete movement of robot arm, and simulation of solar system with planets' orbits.
- Shading focuses on the concepts behind various shading models (which define the appearance of an objectâ€™s surface) and the placement of lights (to illuminate these objects). It includes concepts such as Lambertian, Phong and Blinn-Phong shading.
- Ray Intersection computes ray intersection tests. It tests intersections against spheres, axis-aligned boxes, triangles, and meshes. It also provides a visual debug to draw rays and intersections.
- Blender includes the creation of my own 3D shape, a monitor.
